# React - Shopping Cart

This project builds upon intermediate React concepts and tools such as routers and testing frameworks. The goal is to create a mock shopping cart application, allowing users to add items to their cart, adjust quantities, and navigate between different pages. This project will use a mock e-commerce setup to test skills and put into practice essential React features.

## Features

* Home Page: Display basic information or images. This can be simple since itâ€™s primarily to practice page navigation.
* Shop Page: This page will display products and allow users to add items to a shopping cart.
* Navigation: A navigation bar that appears on both pages. The navigation bar should allow users to switch between the Home and Shop pages easily. The navigation bar should also display the current number of items in the cart and provide a button to view the cart.
* Shopping Cart: On the Shop page, create card elements for each product. Each product card should display:Product title, Input field for quantity selection, along with increment and decrement buttons "Add to Cart" button to add the selected quantity to the shopping cart Fetch product data from an API (e.g., FakeStore API).
* Dynamic Cart Updates: When items are added to the cart, the cart quantity indicator in the navigation bar should update to reflect the total number of items. Users should be able to adjust item quantities directly within the cart view.
* Prop Validation and Error Checking: Ensure that props validation is used throughout the app to prevent missing or incorrect props. 
* Testing: Use the React Testing Library to test the functionality of components.
* Styling: Style the application for a clean, user-friendly appearance. Use preferred styling method (CSS Modules and CSS Styled Components).
